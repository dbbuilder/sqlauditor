## Security Analysis

### Strengths
1. No hardcoded credentials
2. Comprehensive connection string validation
3. Support for secure configuration providers
4. Read-only query enforcement
5. SQL injection prevention through parameterization

### Recommendations
1. Implement Azure Key Vault provider
2. Add certificate-based authentication
3. Implement audit logging
4. Add data masking capabilities

## Performance Characteristics

### Observed Performance
- Connection establishment: < 1 second
- Simple queries: < 100ms
- Metadata queries: < 200ms
- Table analysis: < 5 seconds for small databases

### Optimizations Implemented
1. Connection pooling (when enabled)
2. Adaptive timeouts
3. Query optimization with NOLOCK
4. Retry policies with exponential backoff

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### 1. Test Project Package Resolution
**Issue**: NuGet packages not resolving in test projects
**Workaround**: Use isolated test projects or direct execution
**Resolution**: PowerShell restore script successfully restores packages in Windows

### 2. ConnectionPoolManager
**Issue**: Interface mismatch with IDbConnection vs ISqlAnalyzerConnection
**Workaround**: Temporarily disabled, needs refactoring

### 3. WSL Environment
**Issue**: Package resolution conflicts between WSL and Windows
**Workaround**: Use Windows-native development environment

### 4. TableAnalyzer SQL Query
