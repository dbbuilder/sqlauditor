# SQL Analyzer UI Fixes - Deployment Ready

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Fixed Login Screen Not Showing
- Modified router guard to check for token presence instead of making API calls
- Prevented unnecessary auth verification that was causing 400 errors
- Login page now shows immediately when user is not authenticated

### 2. ✅ Created Connection String Builder UI
- Added visual connection string builder with separate fields:
  - Server and optional port
  - Database name
  - Authentication type (SQL/Windows)
  - Username/Password fields for SQL auth
  - Additional options (Trust Certificate, Encryption)
- Toggle between Builder mode and Manual mode
- Real-time connection string generation
- Shows built connection string in read-only field

### 3. ✅ Fixed SignalR Timeout Errors
- Added token check before initializing SignalR
- Reduced logging level to warnings only
- Skip SignalR initialization if no auth token present
- Prevents connection attempts when user not authenticated

### 4. ✅ Fixed TypeError with visibleOptions
- Set default analysis types instead of fetching from API
- Removed dependency on API endpoint that returns 400
- Added comprehensive, performance, security, and quick scan options

## Connection String Builder Features

### Builder Mode
- **Server**: Text input for server name/IP
- **Port**: Optional port field (shows for SQL Server)
- **Database**: Database name input
- **Authentication**: Toggle between SQL and Windows auth
- **Credentials**: Username/password fields for SQL auth
- **Options**: Checkboxes for Trust Certificate and Encryption
- **Generated String**: Shows the built connection string

### Manual Mode
- Full textarea for entering custom connection strings
- Supports complex connection strings not covered by builder

## Deployment Instructions

The frontend has been built and is ready for deployment:

```bash
# Frontend files are in src/SqlAnalyzer.Web/dist/
# Deploy via GitHub Actions or manually to Static Web App
```

## Testing the Changes

1. **Access the site**: https://black-desert-02d93d30f.2.azurestaticapps.net
2. **You should see**: Login page immediately (no errors)
3. **Login with**: admin / AnalyzeThis!!
4. **After login**: 
   - Connection string builder on main page
   - No SignalR errors in console
   - No TypeError with dropdowns

## Example Connection Strings

### SQL Server with SQL Auth
```
Server=sqltest.schoolvision.net,14333;Database=SVDB_CaptureT;User Id=sv;Password=YourPassword;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

### SQL Server with Windows Auth
```
Server=localhost;Database=MyDatabase;Integrated Security=true;TrustServerCertificate=true
```

### PostgreSQL
```
Host=localhost;Database=mydb;Username=postgres;Password=mypassword
```

### MySQL
```
Server=localhost;Database=mydb;Uid=root;Pwd=mypassword
```

## Known Limitations

- API endpoints still return 400 errors (needs backend fixes)
- Analysis won't actually run until API is properly deployed
- SignalR hub not available until backend is fixed

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the built frontend files
2. Fix backend compilation errors
3. Deploy complete API with all endpoints
4. Test full analysis workflow
